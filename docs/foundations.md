# GSM Foundations & Rationale
{: .no_toc }

**Status:** Non-normative. The deeper *why* beneath the [Manifesto](manifesto.md) (vision) and the [Specification](specification.md) (rules).
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

This page records the foundational commitments that explain *why* GSM is shaped the way it is — the design axioms behind the eight primitives, the DNA grammar, and the deliberate exclusions. It is **non-normative**: nothing here defines conformance. It is meant for readers who want the reasoning, not just the rules.

## 1. The Generative Inversion

Classical systemics *describes* systems; GSM *defines* them. A description records what a system **is**, after the fact, for humans to read. A definition declares what a system **must become** and carries the machinery to get there. GSM's primitives are therefore not passive metadata — they are **active definitions** from which structure, behavior, governance, and viability are *derived and produced*.

This reversal of direction — description flows *from* the system; definition flows *into* it — is the **Generative Inversion**, the irreducible commitment that separates GSM from VSM, GST, and cybernetics (all of which are presented as descriptive). Description and definition are distinct epistemic modes, not synonyms.

## 2. The descriptive entanglement

Classical systemic models are *presented* as descriptive, yet they necessarily rely on constructs that are **definitional in effect**. "What counts as a system," "what counts as a subsystem," "what counts as a function," "what counts as viable" are not measurements — they are **typed categories** that must be fixed before any observation has a stable referent. You cannot decide what to measure, or where the boundary is, without them.

This is not a flaw; it is the nature of second-order reasoning. The problem is that the *descriptive* label **hides** the definitional commitments — and therefore hides *where* normative choices enter. GSM's response is to make those commitments **explicit and first-class** rather than smuggled in under a descriptive banner.

## 3. The automation gap

A human mind can carry the entanglement implicitly: the same mind defines the categories *and* interprets the observations. But for **automation**, that implicit coupling becomes an engineering problem — the definitional commitments are under-specified, not machine-checkable, and not compilable into governance artifacts.

Closing this **automation gap** is GSM's purpose. Making the definition explicit, typed, versioned, and machine-evaluable is exactly what lets software — or an AI agent — reason over "what the system should be," detect divergence, and act. Everything else in GSM follows from this requirement.

## 4. The generative envelope (DNA)

A system's intrinsic identity and self-governance is its **DNA** — its Directives, Norms, and the Ascriptions that bind them. Together these form the system's **generative envelope**: the complete definitional specification from which governance behavior is derived. The envelope *is* the reflexive layer — the system's self-definition, from which self-regulation, self-observation, and self-adaptation follow.

No classical model posits a compilable, complete definitional specification as a system's intrinsic identity. DNA is GSM's.

## 5. No free-form description

GSM primitives **do not** carry free-form `description` text. Human-facing explanation is *inferred* from typed relations, Archetype schemas, and qualifiers — never authored as prose inside the model. This is a deliberate engineering axiom: free text cannot be machine-checked, composed, or kept coherent across domains. Banning it is what keeps the model **compilable**.

## 6. No classification primitives

GSM deliberately excludes **all** classification or labeling primitives — whether for entities (a `Type`) or for organizing governance into subsets (`Domain`, `Category`, `Tag`). Classification is *descriptive opinion*, not *definition*: a label like "WebApp" produces no governance, closes no loop, and auto-defines nothing. What makes a system *this* system is its purpose and its DNA — those are definitional; classification adds nothing.

Classification belongs to the **descriptive plane**, not to GSM. This is the rationale behind several of the Specification's deliberate exclusions ([§15](https://docs.poesis.cloud/gsm/specification/#15-eliminated-constructs)).

## 7. Structural constancy with semantic variation

GSM's **structural form is invariant across domains** — the eight primitives, the DNA grammar, the Ascription lifecycle never change. All domain variation lives in **Archetype schemas and values**, not in structural form. This "structural constancy with semantic variation" is precisely what lets a single engine govern *any* domain: the machinery is fixed, the meaning is pluggable.

## 8. The definition–description duality

Definition and description are complementary, and a complete system needs both:

- **GSM has definitional primacy** — it determines what *counts* as deviation and what *counts* as viable.
- The **descriptive plane has evidential primacy** — it determines what is *actually happening*, the only empirical basis for a governance decision.

> **Definition without description is dogma; description without definition is noise.**

GSM (definition) and the observability/telemetry plane (description — e.g. OpenTelemetry) are the two halves of one governed loop: define what must be, observe what is, and continuously reconcile.

## 9. Autonomous governance from definitional semantics

Because **every** GSM primitive carries definitional semantics — not merely descriptive metadata — an engine can *reason over the definitions themselves*: detect definition–reality mismatch, and produce remediation or evolutionary change autonomously. This is a stronger claim than any cybernetic antecedent: the system does not just sense and correct a variable, it governs the **definition of the state** from which the variable is derived.

## 10. Relationship to prior art

GSM **inherits** the deep insights of classical systemics — viability and recursion (Beer's VSM), open-system structuring and equifinality (von Bertalanffy's GST), feedback and requisite variety (Wiener/Ashby cybernetics), goal refinement (KAOS), and obligation hierarchy (deontic logic). What it **adds** is the generative inversion, the DNA grammar, port auto-derivation, the explicit definition–description split, and the elimination of classification. GSM is not a rejection of prior art; it is its *definitional* completion.
